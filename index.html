		<h2> A bit about me.</h2>
		<p>
		My name is Brandon Dickson. I am 16 years old, I live in Haverhill, Suffolk. I was born in Addenbrookes hospital, Cambridge in 1998.
		I live with my Mum and Step-dad and have two dogs. I am currently at Long Road sixth form college, studying Business and computing.
		When I'm older I want to be a programmer and earn a lot of money. I support Manchester United. In my spare time I go out with my friends,
		go on my laptop, go on my Xbox and other things such as watching films.
		</p>
		<h2>My interests.</h2>
		<p>
		I am interested in computing, I find it fascinating how computers work and I like learning how to program a computer so it does what I want.
		I am also interested in other things such as football and cars. And soon I will have a matte black range rover sport.
